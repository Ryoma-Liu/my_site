I remembered how proud I felt when I received a medal in the Entrepreneurship Competition with the Intelligent and Interactive Street Lighting IoT System I designed.  Since then, I have been working harder than ever on my research to narrow the gap between my research and practical applications. Through systematic training and research at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), and the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/), my experiences and achievements start from mobile robotics to human-robot tactile interaction and eventually focus on the chatbot which solves the humans’ mutual understanding problems. The more I dived in, the more I realized that the ultimate goal of both scientific research and technological work is to solve people’s needs, which is the best reason for me to further study Human-Computer Interaction(HCI).

Having realized that theories and practice cannot exist without each other in engineering, on one hand, I invested heavily in theoretical study and complete 850 hours of Mathematics courses while finishing 3952 hours of courses in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with an overall GPA of 89.4/100.  Thanks to the systematic and rigorous mathematics training at Tongji University, I have built a solid foundation in critical thinking and reasoning abilities. Professional courses such as Software technology and C++ equipped me with excellent programming skills. Unsatisfied with theoretical knowledge alone, I aggressively sought out chances to apply theories into practice to solve user’s needs. When other students called it quit in the face of bottlenecks, I kept going and with each case, my skills and experiences grew. During the [National Electronic Design Competition](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yb411B7VE), I successfully designed and created a wireless charging circuit with Altium, which enabled smart cars to run much longer. In the research program at the department of information engineering, I designed a [novel street lamp system prototype](/project/street-light-model) with crowd-sourced control methods to resolve high energy consumption and pedestrian safety problems, during which I became competent in processing sensor data and programming microcontrollers and later published my findings at 2019 ICAICS. I took to heart that when applying a theory to practice, there are often many realistic issues to overcome and chances are that theoretical calculations are far away from the experimental results. From the original intimidation and disappointment to later feeling energized from overcoming challenges has pushed me to be extremely resilient and calm in the face of obstacles, and on top of my robust knowledge network, would serve as a strong foundation for my studies at the University of Michigan.

Based on my experience, what is as important as research skills, is continuous exploration and enhancement of research directions driven by creative ideas and passion. As our world becomes more digitalized, the incorporation of human factors is also gaining traction in the digital world. From working extensively on robots and HCI, I have gradually clarified my research interests: develop intelligent systems that enable new forms of human assistance and interaction, ultimately make the robot or computer more interactive, create a smart digital environment to the real world, and augment our daily lives.

The goal of “making real & useful robots and applications” is exactly what I am pursuing. Transforming robotics from simulation to a real machine in a real-world setting poses immense challenges and uncertainties for researchers. I began to think about how far real autonomous vehicles were away from the simulation in [RAM-LAB](https://www.ram-lab.com/) during my summer intern in HKUST, where I focused on the development of a Sim-to-Real platform for self-driving cars. Unlike previous studies of microcontroller, this time I was challenged to build a 3D virtual environment and make it as close to the real scenario as possible. With my fundamental experience in Unity programming and design, a highly accurate simulator was born, even the interaction force between humans and robots was simulated. The hectic summer months quickly flew by and the smallest progress and this simulator product I made brought me indescribable joy and a sense of fulfillment because it solved real user needs; from this perspective, researching never feels like work or chores to me, but utterly fascinating and satisfying.

As my perceptions deepen, I can see the current research on robotics and other AI applications is gradually advancing; however, making AI applications a reality in humans' daily life still demands answers to problems, such as how to understand the mutual intentions between humans and AI applications, how they interact with each other and so on. Therefore, I mainly focused on robot tactile interaction when researching with Prof. Qi. With my strengths in data analysis and familiarity with tactile sensors, I was tasked to be responsible for the design of a novel robot fingertip attached with tactile sensors to explore detailed properties of touched surfaces and recognize different surfaces. The [findings](/publication/2011-gender-attitudes/) on tactile interaction between robot and object were submitted to ICRA 2021. This summer, I was honored to be recognized by [Prof. Xu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~xwanghci/) and joined her [Lifelong Learning Lab](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~xwanghci/) at UMich as a research assistant. I devoted myself to lead the design and development of an online video chat robot to solve the mutual understanding problems between humans when using video conference tools. My strong programming skills and research foundation allowed me to quickly master storyboard design, Jquery-based front-end design, and Django-based back-end design needed for the project and took them further into a powerful and user-friendly web tool. To make our conference assistant more friendly and comfortable for the users, I read hundreds of publications from talents around the world about their user-friendly design principal. Feeling the close ties between my work in the lab and real-world applications, I brought back new energy and purpose to continue revising the user interface and perfecting the feature design. After nearly three months of work, our conference assistant is close to success and we are preparing to submit our findings to the 2021 CSCW conference.

Thank you so much for reading.
